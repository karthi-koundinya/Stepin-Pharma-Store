## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. **GCC erorr in windows and linux:** installed the gcc msys64 mingw64 properly.
2. **Generation of makefile:** To overcome this problem research on makefiles was done.
3. **Unity testing:** Initially a few testcases did not pass, to overcome this issue debugging of program was performed.
